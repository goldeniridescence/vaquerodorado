        <p>Howdy. I’m currently trying to fulfill my goal of becoming a published writer. This site is my collection of all my writing, which varies in genre - from fiction to poetry, and I dabble in satire and blog writing (when I remember to write at least).</p>
        <p>On this site, you’ll find work I’ve produced. Most of the writing is ordered chronologically, from newest to oldest at the bottom. The header acts a link back to this page. The following genres below link to the relevant genre of my writing. Currently the site is in its beginning stages, so I will be adding more writing and features with time.</p>
        <p>Thanks, and I hope you enjoy my writing.</p>
        <br>
