        <h3>Probably</h3>
        <p>It smells too clean. Undeterred, I keep looking through the hallways.</p>
        <p>In moments like these, I’m problem solver on cruise control: I don’t think about why or the emotional aspects. Problems, especially involving me, need solutions.</p> 
        <p>I find his room: a makeshift paper with Salvador Villarreal written in black Sharpie was fitted into the plastic slits of the sign holder.</p>
        <p>I break into the dank air: cómo está tío?  I ask him.</p>
        <p>No, pos ya vez, aqui nomas, cansado. I understand my uncle: it’s not like he can move around. Bedridden, connected to a couple of tubes, he’s tired of it. He longs for whatever is better than this.</p> 
        <p>Just hold on a bit longer, you’re going home today. 
        <p>He looks confused. A mi casa? Home? 
        <p>I wonder if it’s him, or the ammonia levels. I nod, as I gather my aunt’s belongings. Yes, you’re going home, I tell him in Spanish. Ya compré los boletos de avión. I have exactly two hours to get him to San Antonio International. There’s no time to waste.
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>My uncle had been diagnosed with cirrhosis about a year ago. Here, bedridden, was a man whom used to stand at 6’2”, short-tempered with a booming voice, the patriarch of his small family: a wife, two boys, a one bedroom home behind his mother’s, once the best cook of our family. Now? Now was a man with arms thin, his bones protruding underneath his skin in morbidly fascinating ways. Now was cirrhosis, two kidney tumors, ammonia, the loss of things he could now clearly recount with his newfound time.</p>
        <p>But today, on a sunny cloudless Saturday, my uncle was getting better. He sounded better, even the doctors thought so. He had made the liver transplant list, and UTC, the medical center in charge of my uncle’s case, wanted to see him in two months to cut out the tumors he was growing. Afterwards, hopefully he would get a liver transplant. Talking to my family, my dad, grandma, aunts, uncles, you could sense the optimism.</p> 
        <p>After I got both my uncle and aunt in my beater, I managed to get them to the airport with about 2 hours to spare before their departure time: on to the next thing I thought. This was me now, rushing around, a spinning carousel of things to do, places to be, times to try and make.  Los veo mañana, I told them. I’m flying into El Paso tomorrow anyways, so I’m planning to see them again. Stepping out into the day again, I notice the sun is far west, sinking, the sky turning from blue to pink to red: another day, gone. I get into my beater and head home, probably some lengthy drive to Austin.</p> 
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>            
        <p>I had just come back from El Paso when my mom broke the news to me. She thought that UTC had covered up the reality, and decided to pass the buck to the hospital now responsible for my uncle - that they didn’t want to break the news to us. Es lo que hacen, ya sabían. Maybe. I can’t piece it together, the burden too abstract.</p> 
        <p>He’s not going to make it, she told me.</p>
        <p>I told her I had to go. I really didn’t, but I rather dwell alone than try and be in front of somebody else, even over the phone. Sunk in my seat, facing the apartment complex, I thought about San Antonio, about how I shuttled my uncle just a few days ago, about how I told him I would see him again in December for the holidays. I thought about how I took my aunt, his wife, and told her that things were going to get better in the middle of the men’s clothing aisle at Wal-Mart: she had smiled. And before I knew it, I thought about a lot of things, and about people I hadn’t seen or heard from, those who once were figures, heroes, protagonists, marquee names in my world entire. I thought about girls I once knew, about the one with the short curly black hair, the small glasses, the one that got away to study at Duke, and I thought about the one whose heart I broke, and where she’s been, whether or not she thinks about me, still, and I thought about the one who was my first, and how she broke me, and how now, I didn’t remember any of their voices. I thought about what he had taught me, my uncle, how sometimes you need more salt, to not be afraid to really season it, you know? I thought about how his voice resonated against his deteriorating house on my grandma’s lot, how the sun shone through the window, electrifying, brandishing the otherwise directionless dust. I thought about Sundays, when I was growing up, when we would get together, and my uncle, Salvador, (his name savior in Spanish) would make the menudo, and my dad would wake me up as the sun was rising in the east, the heat already beating down those people making line outside of the bakery to get pan dulce, so soft that it would just melt, and I thought about how in those Sundays, when all my cousins and I, my aunts and uncles and my grandma and grandpa (yes, he was still there: I have to try and not forget him) would eat his food, and we would shower my uncle with praises, secret amens for our good fortune. I thought about my dad, how he was going to lose his brother, how being 50, or any age, is uncharted territory, and now for him was the twilight of a life lived - now was dealing with loss. I thought about how we were going to cope, how I could try and be there for my dad, how to save the man that has always been my own hero - how do you do that? I thought about how some Saturdays, my uncle and my dad would get together at our house, and we would watch all the slate of Mexican soccer games while we had tortas, or sometimes chilindrinas, or tacos, and if we were lucky, sometimes the one team that united us all, Cruz Azul, would pull off the win, and our hunger was quenched, one that no food could satisfy. And then I thought about the other him, the one who broke my grandma’s heart, and then broke all of ours’ when he left us back in 2007 - he went from the same disease my uncle had just been diagnosed with. I thought about how my grandpa looked when I last saw him, slightly shriveled in his casket, a terrible caricature of the man he had once been too. I thought about how he was the enabler to my chocolate addiction, both of us with Snickers and Hersey’s Kisses in hand after he would pick me up from preschool. I thought about that one time me and my cousins found my grandpa’s cigarettes, a carton just one short from being a new pack, and how we threw them away, thinking that a statement like that would finally get him to quit smoking, drinking, vices that accompanied him since he was 14. And I thought about how in his last year, when he finally tried quitting, finally tried turning it around, he started losing it all, his house of cards crumbling to his vices. And I thought about how much, now, I wanted to meet that man, the one atop my immediate lineage, and ask him about who we were, where we had come from, and maybe where we were going.</p> 
        <p>I thought about all of this. But after all this thinking, I thought, about how I finally understood where my mind was taking me. I understood about how in letting go, and eventually in forgetting about the historical figures of your life, you don’t realize in the moment exactly when the last time is.</p> 
        <p>So there, basking in the stilted air, still sitting in the driver’s seat, I overcame the horizon of the question of where was I going with all this thinking, and arrived to the oasis of the answer so clear to me now.</p>  
        <p>I had probably seen my uncle for the last time.</p> 
        <p>Probably.</p>
