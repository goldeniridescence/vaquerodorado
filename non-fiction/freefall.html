        <h3>Freefall</h3>
        <p>This night has gone well. I’ve kept mental count of my stats: four assists, two goals, seven tackles. When I want to get away, I come to Clarke Field on campus, an artificial turf nestled between buildings, near DKR stadium, off of MLK. I play as if Clarke Field is Estadio Azul, a soccer stadium in Mexico City that houses my favorite soccer team. I know pick-up games are the closest I’ll ever get to going pro, so I try my best: I like to compete.</p>
        <p>At the very least, if I have a bad night, I try and defend: even if that means ending someone’s night with a hard, albeit fair tackle, or maybe not so fair. At least if it’s just not letting them score, I try and affect the game. I know. I know. You say it’s just a pick-up game; I’m over the ethics of it.</p> 
        <p>I play mean, borderline dirty (yeah, I still try and lie to myself about my sportsmanship). Like a youth coach, or my dad, once told me about the whole point of defending, “O te pasa el balon, o te pasa el jugador. Pero los dos juntos, nunca.”</p>
        <p>Either the ball passes you, or the player does. But both of them together, never. It’s been my soccer proverb since I heard it.</p>
        <p>When the game ends, my pick-up team congratulates me. I make small talk and tell everyone good game. Jorge comes back from drinking water.</p>
        <p>Dude, are you Tom Brady? he asks. Super Bowl 51 just happened.</p>
        <p>I laugh. Nah, you know I’m better, I tell him. Really, I just finished having another long week; soccer has been my pressure valve lately. My pent-up emotions manifested themselves as effort tonight.</p>
        <p>Whatever, how come you didn’t play like this during intramurals? He’s always quick to humble me.</p>
        <p>I answer, a bit deflated: I have more time to play now.</p>
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>When you go through heartbreak, you tend to go through “freefall”.</p>
        <p>Your significant other becomes the foundation you stand on, so when you break-up, you feel like you’re suddenly skydiving. The feeling can overwhelm, and it can take some time to subside. You claw out onto anything around you to slow the descent and soften the landing.</p>
        <p>At 23, trying to soften the landing is multi-faceted. You reach out to friends that haven’t heard from you in months. If you’re still in college, you join new organizations; you spend time boosting your GPA.</p>
        <p>I saw one girl go from shy, modest, to party animal. Heartbreak, especially in youth, sometimes lead into bad vices, usually alcoholism. Sometimes worse.</p>
        <p>Maybe your parachute is more hours at work. Thanks, heartbreak, for the new title: shift lead.</p>
        <p>Social media goes from “something I should get rid of” to a thinly veiled S.O.S, reeking of desperation, loneliness. Some go as far as making a Tinder/Grindr, or whatever dating profile, to get back into dating, applying the I can’t get hungover if I’m always drunk mentality to love.</p> 
        <p>If your timing is lucky, and you’re into poor decision making, your financial aid or student loans suddenly becomes an all-expenses paid trip to that one place you’ve always wanted to visit (I should add that future you advises you against this).</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m on my second free-fall, two months in. This time around I’m trying to MacGyver a way out: I turned to work, a new organization, more nights out, rejuvenated friendships, lifting weights, and playing soccer. All the time I spent with her now goes into these endeavors. If I’m going to be single, I might as well wallow in my sorrows five pounds lighter, with more money at hand. The only sadness I try to let in now is watching the 49ers become the new Browns, or not knocking in an easy goal. Really, my solution to heartbreak is doing whatever I want and trying to be busy all the time.</p> 
        <p>Don’t be fooled: I’d trade it all in to get her back. She broke up with me, and for legitimate reasons; I don’t blame her. I would have done the same too, and sooner. That said, I fear this freefall will be longer than the first: the first time I left on my own accord, while I got pushed out of the airplane in the second.</p>
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>In 2017, freefall is public.</p>
        <p>Privacy is harder to come by: most aspects of your life are publicized in some way. So much of our lives exist online that heartbreak currently is a public spectacle. You try to change your Facebook status from “In a relationship” to “Single” quietly overnight, and yet, you know that everyone knows.</p>
        <p>You change your profile photos, if they had your ex in them, and you slowly see the “likes” trickling in for the new picture, each a little fissure expanding the agony. You wonder if the other people on the giving end of their “like” grin to themselves sadistically. You might get “are you okay?” messages, and then what? What do you say?</p>
        <p>For me, I teeter between facing my emotions head on and accepting what’s happened, moving on, and trying to be what I think it means to be a man. Spoiler: these interests conflict. I don’t want to be weak, but I know I’m not okay. In the months that have followed, I tried maintaining an online persona that fits somewhere between the three interests, but I know everyone can see through them. I’m hurting.</p>
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>Near Valentine’s, before I traded in my phone for a new one, I uploaded my photos onto Google Drive: I didn’t have them saved anywhere else. Then when I got my new phone, I didn’t bother downloading my images. I figured they were safe and that I would have more space this way.</p>
        <p>A couple of nights ago, a friend asked me to send her a picture of a favorite landscape. Realizing I didn’t one at hand, I went to my Google Drive. I had visited the Grand Canyon last year.</p>
        <p>What I didn’t realize was that prior to visiting the Grand Canyon, I had started dating my ex. Guess what I found when I went hunting for the perfect photo to send?</p>
        <p>For about twenty minutes, I went down memory lane, watching the few videos I have of her trying to take a picture, while I jokingly bemoan her inability to work my phone. Then all the pictures: there are some of us after we played mini golf, where I kicked her ass like I said I would (we were a competitive couple: many of our petty fights started because of games). Or the time she was bed ready, recently showered, hair covered up in a towel. She was posing with a housewarming gift of towels she was giving me months after I had already moved into my apartment. There’s one of her getting ready in my room, where she moved her hand up to cover herself. She didn’t think she was pretty enough yet to be photographed.</p>
        <p>That night two things stood out. One was a short video, where your laughter erupts on my screen, the bittersweet sound of it looping as I kept hitting play repeatedly. Secondly is a screenshot of a Snapchat you sent me: ready for bed, you’re looking at the camera, confidently, sensuously. Your caption reads “Come to me already!” It isn’t unique compared to all the other pictures I have of you, but it still gave me the same rush I got when I first opened that Snapchat.</p>
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>Freefall now also feels longer. Not that either side doesn’t finally “move on”. But heartbreak is time, effort. And in 2017, I’m used to instant gratification: of knowing now, doing now. Anything is fair game as long as it’s stored somewhere on a database, a server, some sort of virtual/physical storage. Mostly everything I want is an arm’s reach away, a couple clicks, a quick search query. So something that takes time, well…</p>
        <p>Instead, technology ends up making matters worse. You end up stalking them online: you look them up: I did. Have they found someone else? You check their social media accounts, or at least the ones where they haven’t blocked you. Your go-to Spotify playlist now has break-up music: Pink Matter by Frank Ocean and Edge of Desire by John Mayer are my on-repeat songs. You now have to delete (or if you’re not there yet, move) photos and screenshots of them. Texts, messages, comments, photos, all these facets we take for granted are now reminders of what you had. They’re usually sour, at best bittersweet. The digital component of your relationship not only conjures more memories, but compounds the time it takes to move on.</p>
        <div class="line-break"><pre>*          *          *</pre></div>
        <p>I feel smaller nowadays: I’m still 6’2”, but I can’t shake the feeling. I think about my Google Drive, how it’s a field of emotional landmines I’m not ready yet to unearth, in fear of it blowing up on me.</p>
        <p>Tonight, I’m back here at Clarke Field, ready to play again. Where everything else feels like it’s spiraling away from me, here, the ball and opposing players can’t get past me if I try. Before I play, I can’t help and think about my soccer proverb.</p>
        <p>After another “great” performance, it clicks.</p>
        <p>Where on the field I practice my proverb, when it came to you and love, I let both pass me by. So I‘ll practice more, in hopes that we play again. Then, I won’t let you and love get away.</p>
